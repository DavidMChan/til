So, for a long time, it wasn't possible to configure the AWS CLI to use a custom endpoint url by default. Since I usually
use Wasabi for my S3 storage, I had to use the `--endpoint-url` flag every time I wanted to use the CLI, pretty annoying, right? Well,
turns out at some point Amazon added a set of useful configs to their CLI. To configure the CLI to use a custom endpoint url, you can
add the following to your `~/.aws/config` file:

```cfg
[default] # Profile -- you can use any profile you want
ignore_configure_endpoint_urls = true
endpoint_url = <your endpoint url>
```
