I use Kubernetes (K8s) to manage both my personal website, and some client-facing projects. Recently, however, I've discovered something that is making my life a whole lot easier: [K9s](https://k9scli.io/) - a terminal-based UI (think htop) for managing Kubernetes clusters.

Some of the awesome features:

-   I can actually see all of my pods running at once, their CPU/memory usage, and what their internal IPs are
-   I can tail logs using a UI, and I don't have to remember all of the kubectl commands to do so
-   I can see if things are dead, or died, at a glance.

If you use Kubernetes, I highly recommend checking out K9s. It's made my life a lot easier.

(Look at that, I'm using a screenshot from their website. I'm not even sorry.)
