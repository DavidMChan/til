In lots of situations, we may need a unique identifier for an object, for example, when running a database transformation,
we may want to create a unique key for each record, or when creating a database, we might want a unique key for each
object in the database. In these situations, I've seen a lot of people use some variant of the following code:

```python
import random
import string

def generate_random_unique_identifier(length=10):
    return ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters) for _ in range(length))
```

I've certainly been guilty of this myself. However, there are a few problems with this approach:

-   It's not guaranteed to be unique. It's possible that two objects will be assigned the same identifier.
-   It's not very efficient. If we're generating a lot of identifiers, we're going to be wasting a lot of CPU cycles
    generating random strings.
-   It depends on the random seed. If we're using the same random seed, we're going to get the same identifiers.

This is fine for a lot of situations, but sometimes we want an identifier that we _know_ is unique. In these situations,
we can use a UUID. UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier. It's a 128-bit number that is guaranteed to be unique
across space and time. It's a standard that was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) as part of the Distributed
Computing Environment (DCE).

![UUID](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQE7t1z5MIsyAA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1674832219636?e=1711584000&v=beta&t=pKoUydiySBrnUvyXCU2-v9fxJbb59nIYkX_mGlilT0o)

There are several variants of UUIDs, which all alter different parts of the UUID (usually the node identifier):

-   UUID(1): Generates a unique number based on the current date/time and the MAC address of the computer.
-   UUID(2): A variant of UUID1 for DCE Security.
-   UUID(3/5): Generates a unique number based on hashing a "namespace" identifer, and a "name". Version 3 uses MD5, and
    version 5 uses SHA-1.
-   UUID(4): Generates a unique number based on random numbers.

Future versions of UUIDs include:

-   UUID(6): a field-compatible version of UUIDv1, reordered for improved DB locality
-   UUID(7): a time-sortable version of UUID4
-   UUID(8): an RFC compatible format for experimenal or vendor-specific use cases.

In python, generating a UUID is as simple as:

```python
import uuid

unique_identifier = uuid.uuid4()
```

Using UUIDs generates identifiers which are guaranteed to be globally unique, and are also very efficient to generate, not
only this, but it's a lot easier to generate, and doesn't depend on a source of randomness!
