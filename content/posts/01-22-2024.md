It turns out that hosting a next.js application in a subdirectory isn't as easy as it should be. There are two major
issues that I've run into when doing this: (1) Handling links to local pages and (2) Handling links to static assets.

The right way to handle this is to set the basePath in the next.config.js file. This will cause the next.js router to
prepend the basePath to all links:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    ...,
    basePath: '/~davidchan/bair_staging',
};

module.exports = nextConfig;

```

Unfortunately, there's still some work to do, as this will only handle the routing. For any links to pages, we need to
replace the `a` tag with the `Link` tag, which will correctly apply the basePath to the link:

```javascript
// From:
<a href="/pages"></a>;
// To:
import Link from 'next/link';
<Link href="/pages"></Link>;
```

The biggest issue, however, is static assets, where the base path isn't applied (even to components such as the
<Image> component). There are several cited options which I've seen online including `assetPrefix` (which is ignored in
modern next.js), the `getRouter().basePath` method (which doesn't work in non-router components), and the `getRuntimeConfig().basePath`
approach (where you specify the basePath in the next.config.js file and then access it via `getRuntimeConfig()`, which
doesn't work on client-side components). Instead, The best thing that I've found is to use `addBasePath` from `next/dist/client/add-base-path.js`:

```javascript
// From:
<img src="something.png" />;
// To:
import { addBasePath } from 'next/dist/client/add-base-path.js';
<img src={addBasePath('something.png')} />;
```

This works in both client-side and server-side components, and it's the only thing that I've found that works for
static assets. It's a bit of a hack, but it's the best that I've found so far.
